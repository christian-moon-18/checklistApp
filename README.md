# The Ultimate Checklist App

A full-stack checklist app using PostgreSQL, Express, and React.

The initial goal was to create a simple full-stack application within a day using ChatGPT. This was indeed a success, and nearly all of the code was generated using ChatGPT.

# The tech stack
- Express for the backend REST API
- PostgreSQL for the DB
- React and React Native for the web and mobile applications
- ngrok to make the API publicly accessible (free account, mostly for the mobile application)
- ChatGPT to write the code

# Next Steps (in no particular order)
1. Document how to recreate the components (postgres and ngrok in particular)
2. Document how to build the application
3. Add user management to make it a scalable application
4. Add Google Calendar integration and an algorithm to schedule in tasks during the day
5. Make the UI nicer
6. Investigate cloud-hosted DBs and infrastucture for the application
7. Add the ability to create multiple checklists
8. Open-source the project to create a truly ultimate checklist application
